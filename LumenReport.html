  <h1>Assignment Report: Reconnaissance Cohort One</h1>

    <h2>Initial Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      It was not easy to decode the letter. I tried to decode it in many different ways, but nothing seemed to work at first.
      Finally, I used an online tool called <a href="https://rumkin.com" target="_blank">rumkin.com</a> to decode the letter successfully.
    </p>

    <h2>Decoded Letter</h2>
    <div class="decoded-letter">
      If this message has reached your eyes, you successfully traced the trail from our small laboratory misunderstanding—Varo’s sleepless accusation—and decoded the shifted letters. Well done.

      A word of caution as you continue your Reconnaissance Cohort One training:

      1. Even aboard Unity Beyond Stars, with its mind‑backups and regrown bodies, carelessness still carries a cost. Restoration is possible, yes, but time, resources, and emotional toll make death a thoroughly inconvenient outcome.

      2. To reinforce this point, locate the only record in the interpersonal archive classified as a deadly incident. Ask HIF‑Lumen if you need guidance filtering the log.

      3. Once you identify that entry, note the report ID; it will steer you to the next waypoint on your orientation quest.

      Remain vigilant. The worlds we’ll enter beyond these bulkheads will not forgive forgetfulness, and neither will vacuum, toxin, or unshielded fusion plasma.

      Treat your future missions, and your crewmates, with deliberate care.

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      After decoding the letter, I received further instructions. Lumen guided me to search for the term <strong>"deadly incident"</strong> in the file named <code>interpersonal_reports.csv</code>. This step took me some time to understand fully.
    </p>
    <p>
      I eventually realized that I needed to use your website instead of the teachersite part of the website to open the puzzle. Once I did, solving the puzzle became quite easy. I asked ChatGPT, as suggested on the site, and it provided me with the seed word required.
    </p>
    <p>
      I initially thought the mission would continue beyond that, but it turned out that this was the final step for now.
